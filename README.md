# Big Data Challenge - Home Sales

## Objective
Use PySpark, SparkSQL and Google Colab to determine key metrics about home sales data provided.

## Process
Spark is utilized to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table. 

## Questions to answer

- Cache your temporary table. Using the cached data, run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.
